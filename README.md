# Code-Editor
"I've developed a web-based code editor using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to write and edit code conveniently within their browsers. The editor offers syntax highlighting, indentation support, and basic code execution features. I've uploaded the project to GitHub for collaboration and sharing. Check out the repository for more details and feel free to contribute!"
